# DE Shaw Coding Test

3 questions, cut off was 2 full + 1 partial, around 32 students were selected for interviews

## Question 1

3 vectors of equal size given. Find number of ways to select 3 numbers(1 from each) such that the sum is divisible by 7.

Constraint : Size of Array is 10^5

## Question 2

Given an array, find the probability of choosing a non empty sub sequence of the array such that the logical AND,OR and XOR of all the numbers in the sub sequence is same. 

If the probability is P/Q, return P*Q_inverse modulo 1e9+7

Constraints: Size of Array is 10^5

## Question 3

Given vector of size 10 which tells the cost of using a digit from 0,1,2,...9. You have to make the largest number using those digits whose cost is exactly X. 

Report -1 if no number can be formed whose cost is X

(Can use multiple instances of same digit, but have to pay for the cost each time you use it)

Constraints: cost[i] between 0 to 10^3
X between 0 to 10^3
